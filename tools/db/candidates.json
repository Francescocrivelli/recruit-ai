Using social network analysis and longitudinal survey data, we found that having a higher proportion of smokers in one's social circle significantly increased the likelihood of smoking initiation and decreased the chances of successful cessation attempts.",

Participants with over 30% smokers in their immediate social network were 2.4 times more likely to initiate smoking within the 2-year study period compared to those with less than 10% smokers in their network."

By representing scenes as continuous 5D functions, NeRF allows for the generation of new viewpoints with impressive fidelity. The implementation from scratch in PyTorch provided insights into the intricacies of volumetric rendering and the optimization of neural networks for scene representation."

In this work, we introduce CASM, a cache-aware scheduler that leverages cache usage patterns to make informed scheduling decisions. Our experimental results show that CASM can improve cache hit rates by up to 25% and reduce energy consumption by 15% compared to traditional schedulers."

This is because of the rapid digitalization of traditional industries, designed to work for decades at a time when security was not a priority. Simultaneously, the available tools to detect these attacks have also increased. This thesis aims to help researchers and industry leaders understand how to implement machine learning (ML) as an early detection tool for anomalies (cyberattacks being a subset of anomalies) in their processes.",
