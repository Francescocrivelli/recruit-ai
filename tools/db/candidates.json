Using social network analysis and longitudinal survey data, we found that having a higher proportion of smokers in one's social circle significantly increased the likelihood of smoking initiation and decreased the chances of successful cessation attempts.",

Participants with over 30% smokers in their immediate social network were 2.4 times more likely to initiate smoking within the 2-year study period compared to those with less than 10% smokers in their network."

By representing scenes as continuous 5D functions, NeRF allows for the generation of new viewpoints with impressive fidelity. The implementation from scratch in PyTorch provided insights into the intricacies of volumetric rendering and the optimization of neural networks for scene representation."
